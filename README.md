This is my portfolio.
It utilises a Python Flask backend and a TailwindCSS frontend. The site is currently running over at PythonAnywhere, 
specifically [here](https://novusys.pythonanywhere.com/).

If you'd like to look at the current, or future design, head over to the 
[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/MP9zPKn8kt8E2fD18oOiKP/portfolio-novu).
